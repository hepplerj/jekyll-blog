title: Digital &amp; Public History
---

<h2>{{ page.title }}</h2>

<p>I am a believer in public history and involving communities in their histories. As a digital historian, I collaborate with colleagues, students, and the community to create digital projects. I am interested in exploring how digital history can intersect with public history and generate projects that conserve and interpret the past.</p>

<p>I'm also something of a scholar-hacker. I prefer plain text where ever possible and write scripts to make my workflow fit my needs. The posts here reflect my attempt to integrate plain text into my academic workflow, discuss programming in the humanities and its application to research, and digital history methods generally.</p>
