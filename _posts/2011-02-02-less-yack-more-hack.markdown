Ryan Cordell at <em>ProfHacker</em> has a post titled "<a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/more-hackety-hack-less-yackety-yack-ruby-for-humanists/30175">Ruby for Humanists</a>" that points readers to two projects designed to teach beginning programmers Ruby basics. I'm humbled that he's included <a href="http://www.jasonheppler.org/2010/12/10/the-rubyist-historian-the-series/">The Rubyist Historian</a> among his projects for learning Ruby. He also points to a free, cross-platform program called <a href="http://hackety-hack.com/">Hackety Hack</a>, which offers interactive lessons for teaching programming basics.
