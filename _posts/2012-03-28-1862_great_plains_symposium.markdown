[Starting tonight with a talk by Donald Worster, the Center for Great Plains Studies is hosting their symposium](http://www.unl.edu/plains/seminars/2012_Symposium/home.shtml) *1862: The Making of the Great Plains*. I'll be at the electronic poster session on Thursday discussing the [William F. Cody Archive](codyarchive.org). Featured speakers at the symposium this year also include Elliott West, Martin Jischke, Richard White, William Thomas, Myron Gutmann, and David Von Drehle.

Saturday, the history graduate students are kicking off the seventh annual James A. Rawley Conference, which we are holding at the Homestead National Monument this year. Coming fresh off of comprehensive exams, this should make for a nice way to end the week.
