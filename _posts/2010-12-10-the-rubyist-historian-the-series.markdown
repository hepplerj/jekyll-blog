Coming off my recent post on <a href="http://www.jasonheppler.org/2010/12/03/how-i-learned-code.html">How I Learned Code</a>, I've decided to write a series of blog posts that will introduce historians to the basics of Ruby that I will eventually publish as a free <a href="http://anthologize.org/">ebook</a>. My hope is to write an accessible introduction to Ruby and demonstrate not only how to write small programs but also think about ways programming can help scholars in their everyday tasks. Although I'm aiming this at historians, my hope is that anyone interested in humanist computing (or Ruby in general) will find this useful. Watch here, follow me on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/jaheppler">Twitter</a>, or <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/JasonHeppler">subscribe</a> to catch updates as I produce them.

You can find copies of code examples in the <a href="https://github.com/hepplerj/rubyist-historian">Rubyist Historian Github repository</a>. The blog series will be available as a free Anthologize ebook download once it's completed.
