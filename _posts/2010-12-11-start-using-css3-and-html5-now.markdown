<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/12/10/why-we-should-start-using-css3-and-html5-today/">Smashing Magazine</a>: "Just like the elusive character from Beckettâ€™s classic play, this day of full cross-browser support is not ever truly going to find its dawn and deliver us this wonderful new Web where our work looks the same within the window of any and every Web browser. Which means that many of us in the online reaches, from clients to designers to developers and on, are going to need to adjust our thinking so that we can realistically approach the Web as it is now, and more than likely how it will be in the future."
