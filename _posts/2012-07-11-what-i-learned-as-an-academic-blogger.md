In 2008, a year after I graduated college and a year into my Masters program, I started JasonHeppler.org.[^fn-precise] My writing here started out slowly, as a visit to the [archives](http://jasonheppler.org/archives.html) can attest. Even so, I never wanted the site to become overwhelming either for myself to maintain or readers that find enjoyment in the things I write about or link to. 

I've been reflecting on the things I've learned as an academic blogger, and [Shawn Blanc's recent post](http://shawnblanc.net/2012/07/50-things/) prompted me to write up a few things I've learned over the last four years of writing here.[^fn1-blogging] Here's an unordered list of thirty things.

* Give yourself permission to write poorly.
* Don't write what you don't want the world to see. Things around here are permanent. (Same is true with Twitter, Facebook, and elsewhere).
* Twitter and blogs are as valuable as conferences.
* Lots of people share your interests. Sharing your opinions and ideas helps you stand out.
* Don't be rude.
* Own your own domain. Don't rely on Twitter, Facebook, Google, or department web pages for your online presence.
* Seriously, [go buy a domain](https://www.hover.com/) if you don't own one yet. Grab your name if you can. Get on Twitter while you're at it.
* Content is more important than pageviews.
* Content is more important than form.
* Take this work seriously.
* Don't take yourself too seriously.
* Go outside.
* Tweaking your design, blogging system, taxonomy, and so on is procrastination.
* Do your research.
* Don't be afraid to offend someone. As an undergraduate professor use to tell me all the time about my writing: **be bold**.
* Admit when you're wrong.
* Be humble.
* You don't have to publish the moment you've written the last paragraph.
* You're a writer, not a blogger.
* Thinking and reading about writing is not the same as writing.
* Learn something new every day.
* Your digital presence generates real relationships. 
* A digital presence leads to friendships and opportunities.
* Sometimes web comments are great. Most of the time [they're not](http://www.jasonheppler.org/2011/03/01/why-i-dont-use-a-commenting-system.html). 
* Meaningful discussions happen on blogs and Twitter.
* Write every day.
* Read every day.
* Take publicness seriously. Writing for your own site is a big leap into being a publically-oriented scholar rather than insular and ivory-towered. 
* Don't think you have to write about Only One Thing. You have various interests inside and outside the academy, your writing can reflect that.
* Work hard. Doing work is hard work.

The overall theme here is to be online. I cannot overstate how important it is to be engaged digitally, ideally on both blogs and Twitter where the humanities community is quite active. I credit my online presence with opening up some professional opportunities that have come my way recently (which I'm not going to reveal right now) as well as introducing me to a lot of people who I admire. The act of writing consistently helps you as a writer, but doing so publically adds to your online reputation as well. You are doing yourself a favor, in a job market that's already extremely competitive, by writing for the web.

[^fn-precise]: To be more precise, I actually started writing for a WordPress blog I called Digital Clio, a collaborative blog I started with Brent Rogers. We both fell out of regular writing mainly due to busy schedules, but I moved my posts from DC over to here.

[^fn1-blogging]: This list could also have been titled "What I've Learned as an Academic Tweeter." Twitter has also proven an important medium for myself both personally and professionally. I joined Twitter roughly around the same time I started blogging.
