<a href="http://theaporetic.com/?p=1679">Mike O'Malley</a>: "Suppose the job of editing and commenting looked more like this? Moder­ated, live interactions, and an ongoing discussion among peers. An editor might choose one article a week. He or she would post the article with a com­ment on its merits/weaknesses. Readers could then comment in real time, acting as peer reviewers, with the editor acting to 'prune' and police the com­ments.  All readers would see opinion evolving, and see the process of peer review in action."
