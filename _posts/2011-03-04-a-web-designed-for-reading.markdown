This excerpt from <a href="http://blog.readability.com/2011/02/a-web-designed-for-reading/">Mandy Brown</a> is going on my wall: "And yet, people do read online. They read more than they ever did. They even read long articles, and straight to the end. They read one article after the other. They crave reading in the quiet moments of the day--waiting in line for coffee, riding the bus, enjoying a glass of wine before their date arrives at the bar. They read while walking down the street; they read at their desk in between tasks; they buy devices that permit them to carry more words than they ever could before--and with those devices in hand they read more and more."
