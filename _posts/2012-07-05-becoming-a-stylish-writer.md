[Rachel Toor argues for academic writing](http://chronicle.com/article/Becoming-a-Stylish-Writer/132677/) that is engaging for a wider audience:

> And so we get a whole lot of academic essays that seem to be written neither by nor for humans, that lack a sense of narrative, and that use an impersonal voice to brandish fancy concepts. Sometimes, as Sword shows, name-dropping is no more than that. She looks at a bunch of articles that use the word "Foucauldian" and finds many of them have only a tenuous connection to anything Michel Foucault—himself a jiggy stylist—ever wrote. Pretension wins out over clarity, originality, or even meaning.
