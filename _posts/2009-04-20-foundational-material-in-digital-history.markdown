<a href="http://transducer.ontoligent.com/archives/250" target="_blank">This post</a> by Rafael Alvarado has been making the rounds on Twitter and got me thinking about, more specifically, what material would be a useful introduction to digital history (as opposed to digital humanities).

If you were completely new to digital history and trying to get a grasp of what it was about and what it entailed, this is the list I would probably hand you.  The texts might be a bit heavy on the development of digital history as a field rather than the theory of digital history, but at twenty-two books, essays, and projects, I thought I'd cut the list off before it became unwieldy. Perhaps I'll add a post about reading material for a theory of digital history to my blog post idea list (which grows and grows...).  Clearly, this list is not a definite canon of digital history, but I think it gives you a good picture of where the field has been and where it might be going.  I've tried to catalogue a variety of projects and reading material that I found important to my understanding how the field has (and is) developed.

Any other suggestions?  Nit-picks?  Disagreements?  Leave a comment, I'd love to hear from you!
