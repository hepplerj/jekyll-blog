[David Smith writes about Africa's Silicon Savannah in Kenya](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/30/kenya-silicon-savannah-digital-technology?CMP=twt_gu), where technology companies are beginning to establish themselves:

> If there is such a thing as an African version of California's Silicon Valley, the country that is arguably leading the race to the future is Kenya.
> 
> Household tech names such as Google, Intel, Microsoft, Nokia and Vodafone all have a presence here, and IBM recently chose Nairobi for its first African research lab.
> 
> Kenyans enjoy faster broadband connections than their counterparts in Africa's economic powerhouse, South Africa. And the government plans to build a $7bn (£4.36bn), 5,000-acre technology city that is already being branded Africa's "Silicon Savannah".
> 
> How did Kenya – a nation that still has its share of poverty and ethnic conflict – get here? "It started as a joke," said Dr Bitange Ndemo permanent secretary at the information and communications ministry. "We said we wanted to beat South Africa – and we did it."
