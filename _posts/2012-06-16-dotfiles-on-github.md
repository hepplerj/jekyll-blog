[Github has a great set of bootstraps and frameworks](http://dotfiles.github.com/) for getting started with your dotfiles. Their guide has some great information. Storing your dotfiles on Github ([as I do](https://github.com/hepplerj/dotfiles)) is an excellent way to backup dotfiles and sync them between machines.
