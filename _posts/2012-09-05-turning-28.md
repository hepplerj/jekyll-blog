Today is my birthday! I had a pretty good year: I passed comprehensive exams, I'm doing a job that I greatly enjoy, I started and completed many projects around the house, made some new friends, built a basic iOS application, read a lot of books, joined the Gradhacker team. All in all, a good year, and I look forward to the next one. 

I'll sign off today with this: I have an idea for a new project relating to data, visualizations, and the humanities. Stay tuned.
