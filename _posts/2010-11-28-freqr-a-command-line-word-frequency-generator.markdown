I wrote this simple Ruby program while enrolled in Prof. Steve Ramsay's Electronic Text course. Â I'm releasing it into the wild for anyone that might find it useful.  You'll need to have Ruby installed on your machine to run the program.  Simply pass the program a file name and it will output to the screen a numerically-sorted list of word frequencies.  <!--more-->

{% highlight ruby %}
#!/usr/bin/ruby -w

# FREQr.rb
#
# Basic word frequency generator.

# Pass the program a file to open
# e.g., $ ruby freqr.rb poe.txt
filename = File.new(ARGV[0]).read().downcase().scan(/[\w']+/)
frequency = Hash.new(0)
words.each { |word| frequency[word] +=1 }
frequency.sort_by { |x,y| y }.reverse().each{ |w,f| puts "#{f}, #{w}" }
{% endhighlight %}

If you wish to make changes to the tool or download a copy, you can find it in my <a href="https://github.com/hepplerj/FREQr">Github repository</a>.
