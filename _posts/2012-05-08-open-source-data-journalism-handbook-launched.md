[The free Data Journalism Handbook seeks to help journalists with the challenges of working with lots of data](http://datajournalismhandbook.org/1.0/en/index.html). The handbook contains case studies and serves as a guide to gathering, understanding, and delivering data. 

> It was born at a 48 hour workshop at MozFest 2011 in London. It subsequently spilled over into an international, collaborative effort involving dozens of data journalism's leading advocates and best practitioners - including from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, the BBC, the Chicago Tribune, Deutsche Welle, the Guardian, the Financial Times, Helsingin Sanomat, La Nacion, the New York Times, ProPublica, the Washington Post, the Texas Tribune, Verdens Gang, Wales Online, Zeit Online and many others. 

It looks like an excellent resource for anyone looking to learn more about working with data, not just if you're a journalist. You can also find the book available in other formats (including epub and mobi) [on Github](https://github.com/Mortimerp9/TheDataJournalismHandbook).
