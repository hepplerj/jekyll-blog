[Yun Xie at Ars Technica interviews Vikram Savkar](http://arstechnica.com/science/2011/06/textbooks-of-the-future-will-be-born-digital-and-accessible/), who is the Senior Vice President and Publishing Director at Nature Publishing Group. According to Savkar, there is large demand for digital textbooks (and rightfully so since it's a [multi-billion dollar market](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/19/AR2008081903230.html) profiting on material that, on average, costs a single student $700 per semester while a digital book should costs far less):

> **Ars**: How will you introduce digital textbooks to university professors and instructors? They’re the ones who will ultimately choose textbooks for classes.

> **Savkar**: California State University is the first to adopt the interactive textbook, so they’ve helped spread the news. We only announced our plan for the textbook about a month ago, and 800 faculty members from colleges signed up the first day to get a demo.

> [...]

> **Ars**: Would a student be able to read these interactive textbooks on laptops, iPads, Android phones, and other devices?

> **Savkar**: Our textbooks are born digital, which means we created it for what digital can do. As I said before, we didn’t write a regular textbook, make PDFs, and put it online. Our textbooks will be available for iPad, smartphones, Androids, and other devices. These textbooks are born accessible.
