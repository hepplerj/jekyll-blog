[Episode 23 of Back to Work](http://5by5.tv/b2w/23) is officially my favorite episode so far. There are a lot of great messages in the entire episode, but I was interested in Merlin Mann's discussion of notebooks and writing.

I think there's something important about your writing notebook: namely, it doesn't matter what you're writing in. You don't need a twenty dollar Moleskine. You don't need a [leather-lined, gold paper edges, artisan paper journal](http://www.macsparky.com/blog/2011/7/8/my-fancy-pants-journal.html). There's something liberating about [Natalie Goldberg](http://www.amazon.com/Writing-Down-Bones-Freeing-Classics/dp/1570624240), who writes in Snoopy-illustrated spiral bound notebooks.

I write in a cheap Moleskine knockoff I picked up at Target, and a softback grid-lined notepad that I picked up from somewhere. These two are my favorite notepads, and there isn't anything that doesn't go into these. It might be notes from a 5by5 episode, a single thought jotted down on a single page, mind maps, several pages of a thought I'm trying to work through, or even writing exercises. My notebooks come with me everywhere, either tossed into a pocket in my backpack, my back pants pocket, or at nerdier moments (my wife always threatens to buy me one of [these](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00260X7LQ/ref=pd_lpo_k2_dp_sr_2?pf_rd_p=486539851&pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&pf_rd_t=201&pf_rd_i=B001E1SZLA&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_r=1KYNEVNXMR9ZDZZAEYHC)) in my shirt pocket. I like [Field Notes](http://fieldnotesbrand.com/), but there are cheaper alternatives that I've opted to turn to instead.

To paraphrase Merlin: If you've got a notebook and you're writing in it, you've got the right notebook. If you've got a notebook and you're not writing in it, a new notebook isn't going to help you.

UPDATE: The pen pictured is a needle point Tul I picked up from Office Depot. At the moment it's my favorite pen.
