Pew Internet Research reports that [e-book reading went up in 2012 while print reading declined](http://libraries.pewinternet.org/2012/12/27/e-book-reading-jumps-print-book-reading-declines/). The survey of 2,252 Americans conducted from October to November found 23 percent of Americans aged 16 or older read electronic books, compared to 16 percent a year ago. Simultaneously, printed book reading declined from 72 to 67 percent.
