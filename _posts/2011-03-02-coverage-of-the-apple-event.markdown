Leo Laporte's <a href="http://live.twit.tv">TWiT Live</a> is covering the event. Endgaget is also <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/03/02/live-from-apples-ipad-2-event/">live-blogging the announcement</a>. I'll be en route to campus, so I'll likely miss most of the live coverage. Coverage begins at 10 am Pacific.
