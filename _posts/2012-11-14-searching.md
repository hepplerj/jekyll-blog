I've long thought of my blog as a public place where I can share thoughts, tricks, and tips. Most of the things here are likely more useful for me than anyone else, but I share things because I assume the things that I find interesting are interesting to others as well. Not to mention that the places where I learn the most are free blog posts and web resources, and my blog is a way of paying it forward. 

Since my blog is my public brain, I often find myself searching the site for things. I don't use any built-in search, so I often turn to the site-specific search in DuckDuckGo. The task is simple. Adding the line:

{% highlight text %}
site:jasonheppler.org
{% endhighlight %}

to search terms restricts the search to that site. Google and Bing work the same way. To make the process a bit faster and less prone to typos I use a TextExpander snippet.

Nothing clever, but useful. TextExpander can be [much more powerful](http://vimeo.com/10125313), but small tricks like this help remove friction in my workflow.
