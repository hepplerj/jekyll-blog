I'm an avid music listener.  Since I spend a lot of time either programming, designing, writing, or reading, I like to have background noise that usually takes the form of music.  But I'm also not a major consumer of music.  I don't buy much music to add to my iTunes library; instead, I spend most of my time using online music services that allow me to listen to great music and discover new things.  Most of my time is spent with <a href="http://www.pandora.com">Pandora</a>, though I often turn to <a href="http://www.hypem.com">The Hype Machine</a> for a different flavor of music. <!--more-->

However, I despise Pandora's web interface and their reliance on Flash (in fact, I've recently <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2010/11/flash_free_and_cheating_with_google_chrome">gone Flash-free</a> on my Mac).  So imagine my excitement when I discovered <a href="http://github.com/PromyLOPh/pianobar">Pianobar</a>, a command-line Pandora client that is rich with features without the bloat of Flash or Adobe Air.  All you need is <a href="http://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a> or <a href="http://github.com/mxcl/homebrew">Homebrew</a> to install Pianobar.  With MacPorts, use these commands:

{% highlight console %}
$ sudo port install libao faad2 libmad cmake git-core
$ git clone git://github.com/PromyLOPh/pianobar.git
$ cd pianobar
$ cmake . &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; sudo make install
{% endhighlight %}

Homebrew is even easier.  Just run:

{% highlight console %}
$ sudo brew install libao faad2 libmad cmake git
{% endhighlight %}

And you're ready to go.  Just hit "?" if you need Pianobar's list of commands.

{% highlight console %}

{% endhighlight %}

Just another step towards going <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/jaheppler/status/24679139192">GUI-free</a>.

UPDATE: Reader David writes in to let me know that Pianobar is now part of MacPorts and is as easy to install by just using

{% highlight console %}
$ sudo port install pianobar
{% endhighlight %}

Homebrew is just as easy.  Simply run

{% highlight console %}
$ sudo brew install pianobar
{% endhighlight %}

Thanks, David!
