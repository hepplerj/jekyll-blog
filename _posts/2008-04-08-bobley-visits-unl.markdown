<a href="http://www.jasonheppler.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/odh-blog.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-33" title="odh-blog" src="http://www.jasonheppler.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/odh-blog.jpg" alt="" width="195" height="115" /></a>Last Tuesday, Brett Bobley, Chief Information  Officer and Director of the newly-minted <a href="http://www.neh.gov/odh/">Office  of Digital Humanities</a> at the <a href="http://www.neh.gov/">National Endowment for the Humanities</a> (NEH) visited the University of Nebraska-Lincoln to discuss grant  programs, tips and suggestions on what makes a great application, how  the NEH peer review process works, and the future of digital humanities  at NEH.  As somebody just entering the professional study of history and  learning the ropes about grants and funding, Bobley's talk was  illuminating and addressed some of the issues confronting digital  scholarship.

Technology is changing the way we create, store,  and present history.  Along with this comes issues of sustainability,  copyright, and access.   The NEH has recognized the role digital  scholarship will play in our future and in 2001 founded the Digital  History Initiative, which became ODH just last week.   Part of their  purpose for existing is to assist digital scholars in the production of  online projects.  After chatting with faculty and other students who  attended the talk, we sense that ODH will play a large role in defining  what exactly digital scholarship will be.  As a leader in assisting  humanities scholars utilize the web,  NEH wields great power in  dictating what exactly digital scholarship will look like.  Looking at  the types of projects NEH decides to fund or not fund will say a lot  about how it and other funding agencies view digital scholarship.  From  Bobley's talk, it sounds like NEH is focused on innovation and  developing new tools for the digital age.

But what about those of us that simply want to use  those tools in the digital realm, not produce them?  Are they left out  of ODH's consideration?  And if so, where will the funding come from for  those who only want to utilize digital tools?  Often times, funding  agencies often follow NEH's lead.  If historians are left out of the  funding opportunities, combined with the budget pressures in academia,  there's a real concern about where additional funding will come from for  our projects, which are normally concerned with utilizing new digital  tools to achieve analysis that cannot be replicated in print.  I think  it's no stretch to say that, for better or worse, NEH's role could  determine the course of digital historical scholarship.

However, that NEH has committed itself to ODH shows  that they are taking digital scholarship seriously, as <a href="http://www.dancohen.org/2008/03/25/nehs-office-of-digital-humanities/">Dan  Cohen pointed out</a> a few weeks ago.  Indeed, despite reduced  budgets, the NEH is there with the funds to help the field develop.  I  also sense that NEH is very concerned with accessibility, which is an  ongoing discussion in digital history.   NEH is committed to allowing  anybody access the great heritage of this country.  As more and more  people turn to the web for their first (and sometimes only) stop for  information, it's important that accessibility for all is maintained.

It's important that historians maintain a role in  this conversation.
