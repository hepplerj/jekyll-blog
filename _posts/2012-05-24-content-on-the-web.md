[Dan Cohen on the lack of publicly-created material on the web](https://twitter.com/dancohen/status/205670836693250048):

> Over 70% of new content on the web is now produced by individuals, & very little of it can be archived because it's in places like Facebook.

An amazing statistic. I tend to keep a lot of the things I create -- blog posts, shared links, and so on -- publicly available because I don't want things locked behind a wall. Hence my preference for Twitter and Tumblr (which, incidentally, also updates Facebook and Twitter when I post something new).
