[Tim Kreider writes about the importance of idleness](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/30/the-busy-trap/) not only to our creativity and productivity, but to our health:

> Idleness is not just a vacation, an indulgence or a vice; it is as indispensable to the brain as vitamin D is to the body, and deprived of it we suffer a mental affliction as disfiguring as rickets. The space and quiet that idleness provides is a necessary condition for standing back from life and seeing it whole, for making unexpected connections and waiting for the wild summer lightning strikes of inspiration â€” it is, paradoxically, necessary to getting any work done.
