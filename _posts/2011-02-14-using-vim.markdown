If you follow me on Twitter, it's no secret that I'm a big fan of <a href="http://www.vim.org/">vim</a> (or <a href="http://code.google.com/p/macvim/">MacVim</a>) for my programming needs (I'm also a huge fan of TextMate and often jump between the two). There are several posts that have aided me or inspired me in my pursuit of mastering vim. A recent post by Jonathan Snook <a href="http://snook.ca/archives/other/word-of-vim">discusses his journey</a> into the world of vim. One of my absolute favorite posts on vim is <a href="http://stevelosh.com/blog/2010/09/coming-home-to-vim/">this piece by Steve Losh</a>. <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/how-i-boosted-my-vim/">Vincent Driessen's post</a> on vim is also an excellent read. Consulting <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/059652983X?ie=UTF8&tag=jasohepp-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=059652983X">O'Reilly's vim book</a> is also quite handy. If you're interested, here's <a href="https://github.com/hepplerj/vimrc">my .vimrc file</a>.
