I just finished reading James Gleick's [The Information: A History, a Theory, a
Flood](http://around.com/the-information), and can report that it is an excellent
read and great introduction to the history of information and the ways humans have
organized, thought about, and tried to manage information. Gleick covers a wide array
of material, beginning with writing and the alphabet (what he called the "founding
technology of information," p. 24) and taking readers through Charles Babbage,
physics, mathematics, the Internet, and concludes with thoughts on the meaning of information and
the conclusion that "forgetting takes work" (p. 362). An excellent book given my
research interests, but a good read for anybody who does the history and philosophy
of computing, digital humanities, or the history of technology.

He concludes thinking about meaning. Information theory, he says, ignores the meaning
of information -- information means nothing unless it means something to someone. For
Gleick that does not come in the form of Google's tools or hypertext or abundance of
data. Rather, meaning comes from human choice "selecting the genuine takes work."

I have some more thoughts on this that I'm writing up for my digital humanities
seminar, and will post that here once it is finished. Namely, I am thinking about the
interplay between information and knowledge, what digital humanities offers us in the
way of moving information towards knowledge, and the limits we currently face in that
endeavor.
