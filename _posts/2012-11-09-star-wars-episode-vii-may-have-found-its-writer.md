[Claude Brodesser-Akner says that Star Wars Episode VII may be written by Michael Arndt](http://www.vulture.com/2012/11/star-wars-episode-vii-may-have-found-its-writer.html):

> Informed sources tell Vulture that Star Wars: Episode VII has found a leading candidate to write the filmâ€™s screenplay: Michael Arndt, the Pixar favorite who was nominated for an Oscar for Toy Story 3, won an Oscar for Little Miss Sunshine, and wrote The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, which is currently shooting. Insiders confirm that Arndt has written a 40- to 50-page treatment for the film and is likely to be at least one of the writers when the Disney/Lucasfilm project begins shooting in 2014.

A good move, and hopefully evidence of a fruitful talent share between Pixar and Star Wars.
