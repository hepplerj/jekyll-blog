<p><strong>Hi. I'm Jason.</strong></p>

<p>I'm a writer, historian, hacker-scholar, and tech enthusiast. I grew up in South Dakota and currently live in Lincoln, Nebraska, with my wife and our two dogs. We will soon be moving to San Jose, California.</p>

<p>I serve as the Academic Technology Specialist in the <a href="http://history.stanford.edu">Department of History</a> at <a href="http://stanford.edu">Stanford University</a>, where I work with faculty and graduate students on digital history.</p>

<p>I am a Ph.D. Candidate in <a href="http://history.unl.edu">History</a> at the <a href="http://unl.edu">University of Nebraska-Lincoln</a> specializing in the North American West, 20th century United States, and digital history. My dissertation research focuses on post-1945 American urban history, particularly examining how technology influenced local politics and culture in the four cities that were the original nodes of ARPANET.</p> 

<p>Prior to joining Stanford, I served as the project manager for the <a href="http://codyarchive.org">William F. Cody Digital Archive</a> at the <a href="http://cdrh.unl.edu">Center for Digital Research in the Humanities</a> on the campus of UNL. I have contributed to several digital history projects, including <a href="http://digitalhistory.unl.edu">The Digital History Project</a>, <a href="http://railroads.unl.edu">Railroads and the Making of Modern America</a>, <a href="http://buffalobillproject.unl.edu">The Buffalo Bill Project</a>, <a href="http://segonku.unl.edu/~jheppler/showindian/">Buffalo Bill's Wild West and the Progressive Image of American Indians</a>, and <a href="http://framingredpower.org">Framing Red Power</a>. More academic information can be found in my <a href="http://jasonheppler.org/jah-vita.pdf">curriculum vitae</a>.</p>

<p>As a bit of a work-related hobby and productive procrastination, I am interested in programming and the history of programming languages. In 2011 I wrote an ebook called <a href="http://hepplerj.github.com/rubyist-historian/">The Rubyist Historian</a> that intended to introduce humanities scholars to the basics of the Ruby programming language and its application to their everyday work. I am currently working on porting <a href="http://programminghistorian.org/">The Programming
  Historian</a> over to Ruby. In addition to Ruby, I spend my days working with Bash, PHP, and Python, and have dabbled with Objective-C.</p>

<h2>About Here</h2>

<p>I write on a range of topics. Although I generally write on digital history and technology, my posts range from culture, music, coffee, ideas, and anything else that strikes me. There is no schedule or length that I seek to meet.</p>

<p>The site originally ran on WordPress but moved to <a href="https://github.com">Github</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> for static blogging in early 2011. My posts are now version controlled with git. Most of my writing and coding happens in <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2">Sublime Text 2</a> or vim on my MacBook Pro. I use to be a heavy TextMate user, but remain unsure about it's future. The design of this site has changed frequently, mainly because I enjoy tinkering.</p>
